                    "value": "<p><em>Anadi people are reclusive, sapient spiders who hail from the jungles of southern Garund. Though they act in many ways like natural-born shapeshifters, their twin forms actually stem from carefully developed magic.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>As a communal and peaceful people, anadi ancestors endeavored to establish trade with the neighbors of ttheir homeland. However, these anadi soon learned that most others found their appearance to be extremely objectionable. Wishing to avoid conflict, ancient anadi retreated into isolation until they could find a solution. The answer came when their greatest scholars innovated a fusion of transmutation and illusion magic that allowed them to assume a humanoid form. The technique was developed, perfected, and eventually taught to the overwhelming majority of anadi.</p>\n<p>Early efforts with their new approach to diplomacy have yielded much better results, though sporadic contact means that some outsiders whisper false legends about anadi, such as claims that they are humans who transform into monstrous spiders at moonrise. Even contemporary explorers have reported anadi as human-spider hybrids. The anadi people of the current day strive to slowly but surely create a world where they no longer need to hide their true nature.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Only reveal your true form to people who have earned your trust.</li>\n<li>Openly express sympathy for misrepresented and unfairly stigmatized cultures.</li>\n<li>Provide for those you hold dear and defend them from danger without hesitation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Appreciate your willingness to seek nonviolent solutions to complicated problems.</li>\n<li>Have a strong reaction to seeing your natural form.</li>\n<li>Assume you have an affinity for druidic magic, given your ability to transform.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Anadi in their true form resemble human-sized spiders with a variety of colorations. Some tones look simple or muted while other remain striking and vibrant, with most patterns inherited from an anadi's parentage. A typical anadi measures five feet in length from their front legs to their rear legs when standing comfortably.</p>\n<p>All anadi possesses the ability to transform into a human guise. This form can resemble any human ethnicity, but it's usually one that blends in with the region of an anadi's hatching. Anadi reach physical maturity after 13 years, going through multiple phases of molting along the way. A typical anadi lives to be about 80 years old.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Anadi live in a communal society, sharing peaceful lives farming mushrooms or weaving warm blankets. Their culture places great value on cooperation and mutual respect. Due to this cultural upbringing, anadi often have issues facing severe conflict and often come off to other ancestries as very shy. Their history of dealing with arachnophobia in other peoples-which anadi understand is often instinctual and very difficult to control-likewise means that anadi do their best to be accommodating and comforting, even in situations that aren't necessarily fair to them.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>The cooperative nature of anadi society and their dislike of violence means many anadi lean toward good alignments. They're more often neutral than chaotic or lawful, though the latter aren't unheard of.</p>\n<p>Legends say Grandmother Spider rescued anadi people from servitude and brought them to Golarion, becoming their patron deity in the process. Her values of mutual care and playful trickery interweave into anadi culture, and even those who don't worship her tell tales of her adventures.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Anadi names are given by the members of the web marriage that raised them. Each parent contributes a single syllable, usually the first, from their own name. Older anadi who feel their identity has settled often take on or are given a phrase-title to honor them as well. Anadi who live among human populations rarely take a cover name, but some might adopt one if their given name strongly contrasts the norm in the local culture.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Altava, Anavachti, Strings-On-The-River Inkeelah, Kerialnamu, Maracha, Leaves-Shelter-Her-Feet Naiala, Orvasa, Reloana, Rivuken, Velachamon</p>"

                    "value": "<p><em>Technological wonders from another world, androids have synthetic bodies and living </em><em>souls. Their dual nature makes them quick-thinking and calm under pressure, but </em><em>comfortable in stillness and solitude.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Androids first arrived on Golarion during the Rain of Stars, when an interstellar vessel from the far-off planet of Androffa crash-landed, scattering debris across Numeria. While some android survivors of this crash still walk Golarion today, most were created from the technological pods, known as foundries, that operate sporadically amid the starship's wreckage. Androids birthed from these mechanical wombs possess mature bodies and newborn souls, both organic and synthetic; they emerge knowing only their creators' language and the motor skills necessary for survival. They have no understanding of their surroundings, origin, or purpose. Most learn how to behave through keen observation while wandering Numeria.</p>\n<p>Androids tend to be logical introverts, rational and contemplative. Insatiably curious, with an urge to understand themselves and the world around them, androids place great value on intellectual pursuits. They have difficulty interpreting and expressing emotions, both in themselves and in others, which makes them seem distant and uncaring. While androids can forge emotional bonds, they find it more difficult to connect with non-androids.</p>\n<p>If you want a character that's a synthetic foreigner in a fantastic world, forced to learn the nuances of reality and society through the powers of observation and logic alone, you should play an android.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Keep your identity a secret, assuming others want to exploit or harm you.</li>\n<li>Plan ahead, preparing multiple contingencies for even simple tasks.</li>\n<li>Calculate the repercussions of your actions, inventions, and thoughts before sharing them.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Assume you understand how to operate technology and that you can capably communicate with constructs and robots.</li>\n<li>Believe you to be immortal and envy your eternal youth and vigor.</li>\n<li>Think you have no feelings and that you can't form emotional connections with others.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Androids were created in humanity's image; thus, foundries produce androids that represent all humankind. Androids display great diversity in coloration and ethnicity, height and body shape, and gender identity. Androids breathe, eat, and sleep like a human, although they're incapable of biological procreation. Their bodies contain microscopic nanites, transported by fluid too watery to be blood, that manage their organic processes. These nanites are controlled through biological circuitry that resembles tattoos and is typically located along an android's hands, forearms, face, or neck. Many androids can harness their nanites to increase their bodies' efficiency, causing the circuitry to glow.</p>\n<p>Androids don't grow old. Instead, their organic appearance becomes less convincing over time, causing them to look more artificial. After a century, most androids feel their time coming to an end and willingly release their souls to the Boneyard to face Pharasma's judgment. Their bodies then shut down, entering a lifeless hibernation as their nanites begin restoration protocol and reset their synthetic bodies to their original manufactured state. After a few weeks, a new soul enters the android's form, triggering reinitialization. This process, called Renewal, is an event to be celebrated, akin to bearing a child. Those that die by violence can't Renew, so androids go to great lengths to protect themselves and their brethren from harm.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Androids have a history of being exploited, enslaved, and destroyed by their Numerian neighbors, so they hide in order to survive. Most choose to keep their ancestry secret by integrating into human society or by adapting to a nomadic lifestyle. Some androids eschew humanity to live among their kind. Such groups often remain small by necessity; while a pair of androids can avoid danger through careful secrecy, large groups attract too much attention.</p>\n<p>Android communities are efficient and highly organized. Each citizen understands their role and takes pride in filling it effectively. Debates and lectures frequently occur, as androids seek to understand themselves and their world through education and inquiry. These insular and secretive enclaves relocate when discovered.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Most androids are neutral. They care for their own safety and that of their companions and their kind. Androids interested in religion usually worship Casandalee or Brigh, goddesses that unite invention and life. Other popular deities include Desna, Irori, and Gozreh.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Androids adopt the naming conventions of their surrounding societies, while those raised among their own kind instead select a single name that utilizes Androffan phonology. Occasionally, such androids add a numerical designation to their names, denoting how many generations their body has hosted life as a kind of homage to their bloodline.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Sample Names</span></h3>\n<p>Anati, Daniv, Era-4, Feralia, Gelegor, Ilgos-5, Koresh, Oris, Prime, Urdun, Verity-3, Ymry</p>"
